Can you also ask him to show you the past quizzes because his teacher suggested to re-study and review the past courses before the exam and that should be very helpful

Please let him repeat the concepts and terminologies and check on him, asking questions to make sure he truly understand because a lot of times he would say I know I know I understand I understand,
 but actually he cannot repeat it or answer questions
